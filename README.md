# <Web-Agenda>

## Description

This project was created in order to have a reliable daily planner.
- Everyone needs to sort out their life, why not start with a scheduler!
- During this project, I learned how to use Day.js to incorperate live hours into a project to be used to determine the current, past and future times.

## Features

-Allows for saving data on each hourly block.<br>
-Stores data in user local storage.<br>
-Time blocks are dynamically updated through each hour of the day.
